# Socks

## Context

(Based on a true story!)

You received socks for Christmas.
A lot of socks.
You like socks.
But, for some reason, you just can't quite grasp the concept of pairing socks according to their patterns.
You would rather know, from your total of socks, the number of _different_ pairs you can make.
This is weird.
We like weird, here!

## Summary

Your program must be able to display, from N socks given as parameter, the total of different pairs you can make.

## Example

```
$ ./socks 4
6

$ ./socks 12
66

$ ./socks 10000
49995000
```
