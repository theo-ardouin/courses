# Pascal's Triangle

## Context

Your name is Pascal.
You don't know about triangles.
You like triangles.
You want to learn more about triangles.

## Summary

Your program must be able to display the sum of the first N numbers of the [pascal's triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle).

Moreover, with the option '_-v_', you must be able to display the complete triangle.

As always, your goal is to make a _functional_ algorithm first, and optimize afterwards.
For instance, a [recursive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)) algorithm is easy to make, but usually terrible regarding performances.

You should be able to have a functional algorithm _at least_ until the 20th number.

## Example

```
$ ./pascal 1
1

$ ./pascal 10
15

$ ./pascal -v 10
   1
  1 1
 1 2 1
1 3 3 1
```
